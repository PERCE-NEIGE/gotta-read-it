gotta-read-it
=============

Gotta read it gives you a simple way to make a note of an interesting piece of content on the web that you may want to come back to later. It makes use of the familiar bookmark system in Firefox but lets you choose a few of your most important categories (tags) and presents them as simple textual lists. Each list's contents can be reordered to keep the most important items near the top.

If you regularly bookmark lots of pages this addon could help you sort through your bookmarks and focus on the most valuable content.
